# ai-recruitment-system

This is a recruitment web portal that uses Artificial Intelligence to shortlist job applicants. Recruiters are able to create an account and post job offers. Job seekers are also able to create an account and see all job offers based on their interests.

<b>Getting Started</b>
- Create a MySQL database
- Edit dir file => "root/_sys/db_connection.php".
  (Fill in database name, host and password)
- Upload files to live server or htdocs/www directory
- Run "{domain_name}/_sys/db_connection.php" in web browser
  (If you get a blank page, you're good to go.)
- Run "{domain_name}/_sys/_tables.php" in web browser to create all the database tables.
  (Once all tables are created, you should see success messages in your browser.
- Now open {domain_name} to get started.

That's it!!!
